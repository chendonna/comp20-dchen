1. This github repository contains all the assignments and labs done throughout the class.

2. My favorite assigment this semester was the landmarks assignment because I thought working with different APIs and 
servers was interesting. I think I prefer working with clientside rather than serverside (even if it means dealing with 
javascript).  

3. I think I have grown a lot from day 1 as I had been afraid to ask for help or ask questions previously. Now, because 
of this course, I realize it's okay to ask questions about topics that you do not understand and many people are willing
to help you.

4. The most important thing I have learned from this course is to be more resourceful. Instead of relying on what the 
professor gives us or the TAs too much, I was able to google something that I did not undestand and work off of questions
from StackOverflow or online documentation. For example, for the comp15 hw6 assignment, we were allowed to use the standard
template library. I read through the documentation for the data structures that I needed and was able to implement that 
correctly in my program. For most of the labs and assignment, I was able to figure out how to implement specific features
through much googling. 

5. I want to learn more about security and breaking websites because for assignment 4, I did not spend as much time on it 
as I would have liked due to my own poor time management skills. I would also like to learn more about different databases
besides mongo because from what I have seen of it in the semester group project, I do not like it very much.
